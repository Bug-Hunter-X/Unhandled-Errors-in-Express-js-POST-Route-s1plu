# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in POST request routes.  The `bug.js` file shows a vulnerable POST route that doesn't handle potential errors, such as malformed JSON requests.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and improve application robustness.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install express` to install the required dependencies.
3. Run `node bug.js` to start the server.
4. Send a malformed JSON payload to the `/users` POST endpoint.  Observe that the server might crash or behave unpredictably.

## Solution

The solution involves adding proper error handling to catch and gracefully manage potential issues with the request body.
